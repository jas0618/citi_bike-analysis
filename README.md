The first two visualizations provide an in-depth analysis of Citi Bike users, categorizing them based on their membership statusâ€”whether they are casual riders or subscribed members. These visualizations examine user distribution at both the start and end stations, the average distance traveled, and the percentage breakdown of total riders within each rider group. The insights derived from these charts will be integrated into an interactive dashboard, allowing users to filter the data based on membership type for a more personalized analysis.

The next two visualizations highlight the top 10 most frequently used Citi Bike stations. The data is sorted from highest to lowest usage, providing a clear ranking of the most popular stations among riders.

Additionally, two geospatial maps illustrate the geographical locations of start and end stations. These maps use latitude and longitude coordinates to plot the stations while also incorporating the number of riders at each location for better context.

Finally, an interactive visualization links the start and end station locations with the top station rankings. This integration enhances the user experience by providing a seamless way to explore how different stations are utilized and identify key transit patterns within the Citi Bike network.
